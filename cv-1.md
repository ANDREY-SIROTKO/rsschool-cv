### **Briefly About Myself:**
#### I decided to radically change my life. Striving for the best is always good. Many years later, I came to the conclusion that the sphere (construction) in which I now work does not open up such opportunities and prospects for me that I would like to see. On the recommendation of friends and acquaintances, I decided to try myself as a front-end developer. The profession seemed to me very interesting, exciting and promising.
#### Without hesitation, I signed up for a long time and mastered the HTML, CSS, JavaScript course at the IT-Academy (November 2021-January 2022). I am finally convinced of my choice and that is why I am here.

#### I am sure that my determination, perseverance and responsibility will allow me to successfully complete the course at RS School and in the near future connect my life with a new industry for me.
